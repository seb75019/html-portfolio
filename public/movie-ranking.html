<h1>The Best Movies According to Sebastien</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Lost in translation</h3>
<p>Shows the intercultural relationship between the US and Japan, <br />and a way to travel there also.</p>
<h3>Dead poets society</h3>
<p>Loved how the teacher learned his pupils to think for themselves, <br />and seize the day.</p>
<h3>American beauty</h3>
<p>A little weird for some, but a unusal plot, with unexpected ending.</p>
